# Overview

This repository contains code and resources related to my research on artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning. The main goal of this project is to explore different approaches to solving problems in these fields and to document my findings.

## Purpose

This repository is a collection of my research work in the exciting and rapidly evolving fields of AI, ML, and DL. It contains Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, datasets, and documentation related to various topics such as text to speech, AI-assisted coding, natural language processing, computer vision, and deep reinforcement learning, among others. 

The code implementations are written using popular Python libraries used accross the AI, ML, and DL fields. The repository is well-organized and easy to navigate, with README.md files providing an overview of the contents and subdirectories containing specific research topics and related code. Most of the work in this repo was generated with the aid of multiple language models and AI's currently available in the private and open-source communities. I encourage others to contribute to the repository by sharing their own research findings and code implementations.

## Methodology
The use of AI: For the purpose of this repository, AI is being used as a learning tool. It is not being used to solve specific problems, but rather to help me better understand coding concepts and techniques. By leveraging AI and machine learning, I am able to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying principles of coding and data science, which in turn allows me to create better code and more effective research experiments.

Validating AI-generated answers: As this project progresses, one of my main objectives is to develop a robust methodology for testing the answers and examples generated by AI. It is important to ensure that the AI is providing accurate and reliable results, and that any errors or inaccuracies are identified and corrected. I will be using a variety of methods to validate the AI-generated answers, including manual inspection, testing against known datasets, and comparing results with those obtained using traditional coding techniques.

Learning to code with AI: As a beginner coder, I am using AI to assist me in learning coding concepts and developing my skills. By using AI, I am able to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying principles of coding, as well as the various tools and libraries available for Python development. Over time, I hope to build my expertise in the field of AI and machine learning, and to use this knowledge to contribute to the wider research community.
